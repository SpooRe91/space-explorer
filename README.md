A website about space, NASA and everything in that regard

This website is a semi-one pager, it will have few page views, and mainly it's focused
on fetching information from NASA's API and providing it to the cosmos and astronomy lovers.

The website will include a NASA picture of the day, different reading materials and media.

Also some more features are to be added.
